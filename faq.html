      <p class="mt-3">(1 hour): The first part of the tool is about laying out your product, considering the ethical values you are trying to embed in it, and receiving feedback about areas of possible ethical issues.</p>

      <p class="mt-3">(1.5 hours): The second part of the tool is about moving from “issue” to “challenge” to action. We help you to identify the key challenge(s), give you further tools understanding the roots of the challenge and how you can address it accordingly.</p>

      <p class="mt-3">(): When you’re done, you will be able to demonstrate how your product works, its values and aspirations, as well as some thought-provoking ethical issues that you need to consider as you continue your product development.</p>

      <p class="bold mt-6">Who should join?</p>
      <p>If you are a team working on a product, we suggest you gather a group of at least three people with different roles and sets of knowledge: a product manager, a designer, a developer, the CEO. Other important roles at the table could be: UX designer, user researcher, marketing, public relations. If you do not have clear roles in your team/group yet, try assigning roles to your team members and ask them to put themselves in the shoes of that role.</p>

      <p class="mt-3">We’ve developed the Ethical Stack based on research in VIRT-EU, co-creation and testing sessions. We’ve seen start-ups and small companies* benefitting from using the Ethical Stack tools in three ways:</p>
      <p class="mt-4 light">1. You want to check if you're on the right track.</p>
      <p class="">We want to demonstrate that we have focused on ethics when building our entire product. We want to use this as a team exercise to get on the same page and also invest in some internal training for ethical reflection. Map out the Entire product. Uncover ethical challenges. Deal with [some of] them.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 light">2. You're unsure about a couple of things.</p>
      <p class="">You would like to be more critical of certain areas of your product and have support to discuss those. Use our guiding questions to prompt these discussions and the tools to facilitate collaboration. Map out this Area. Uncover your product’s ethical challenges. Deal with [some of them] by re-designing.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 light">3. You are at a decision-making moment and want to get some help.</p>
      <p class="">You’re trying to make a decision - whether to use this or this specific element in your product, or whether it will be “ethical” to try to shift your product to a different user group. Map out the Decision across the Ethical Stack. Uncover ethical challenges about each branch of your decision. Consider them in your resolution. </p>
